# CAB — Computer-Aided Brainstorming rules

## Purpose and Mission
CAB is the **exploration and conceptual genesis phase** of the QAL ecosystem. Its mission is to translate market needs and strategic objectives defined in CAO into a diverse and evaluated set of solution concepts. CAB acts as an innovation funnel, using computational tools to explore vast design spaces, generate novel ideas, and select the most promising candidates for development in CAD.

## CAB-Specific Requirements

### Quantum-Enhanced Concept Generation
- **QML Latent Space Navigation**: Use quantum machine learning to explore novel design configurations
- **Grover's Algorithm**: Accelerated patent and literature search for prior art and innovation opportunities  
- **Maximum Entropy Principle**: Guide concept generation toward radically different solutions

### Artifact Requirements
- **Concept Sketches**: Visual representations in SVG format for scalability
- **Feasibility Scorecards**: Machine-readable CSV with multi-criteria evaluation
- **Trade Study Reports**: Comprehensive PDF documentation with decision rationale
- **Rationale Graphs**: JSON format for traceability and decision trees
- **Selected Concept Sets**: JSON format with CAE seeding information

### DET Emission Rules
Emit DET for all major CAB activities:
- `DET:CAB:<MIC>:<SNS>:concept_generation:V<rev>` - New concept ideation
- `DET:CAB:<MIC>:<SNS>:feasibility_analysis:V<rev>` - Multi-criteria assessment
- `DET:CAB:<MIC>:<SNS>:trade_study:V<rev>` - Comparative analysis
- `DET:CAB:<MIC>:<SNS>:concept_selection:V<rev>` - Final selection for CAD

### Integration Requirements
- **CAO Inputs**: QAL-Policy-Pack, Strategic-Objectives.yaml, market needs
- **CAD Outputs**: Selected-Concept-Set.json with CAE seeding hints
- **Traceability**: Every concept must trace to original requirements
- **Evidence**: All quantum algorithm runs must be logged with seeds and parameters

## BWB-Q100 Specific Focus Areas

### Multi-Bubble Pressure Vessels
- Explore alternatives to conventional cylindrical pressure vessels
- Consider tetrahedral arrays, fractal distributions, bio-inspired cells
- Trade-off: fatigue life vs. weight vs. volume efficiency vs. manufacturing complexity

### Hydrogen System Architecture
- Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) concepts: active cooling, passive insulation, hybrid approaches
- Integration with BWB configuration constraints
- Novel cryogenic insulation geometries discovered through quantum exploration

### Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI)
- Active flow control concepts
- Distributed propulsion architectures
- Integration with BWB aerodynamics

## Validation Rules
- All YAML files must validate against yamllint
- Concept sets must include CAE seeding information
- DET patterns must include quantum algorithm parameters (seed, backend, algorithm)
- Cross-domain references must use proper ALIAS patterns
- Rationale graphs must maintain bidirectional traceability

## KPIs and Metrics
- **Exploration Breadth**: Number of solutions explored vs. selected
- **Concept Quality**: Feasibility and novelty scores of generated concepts  
- **Requirements Traceability**: % of final concepts traceable to original need
- **Funnel Efficiency**: Conversion rate from ideas to viable concepts
- **Quantum Confidence**: Algorithm confidence scores for quantum-generated concepts

## Handoff to CAD
The Selected-Concept-Set.json must include:
- `CAE_Seeding` section with key load paths and mesh density hints
- `boundary_condition_hints` for simulation setup
- `key_features` with quantified benefits (e.g., "15% weight reduction vs. conventional")
- `quantum_score` indicating confidence in quantum-generated insights
- `DET_hash` for immutable evidence chain
