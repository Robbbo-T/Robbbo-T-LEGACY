## CAT rules
- Plan physical tests using building block approach and quantum-optimized DoE matrices.
- Generate **test evidence** DET packets with complete sensor data and CAE correlation.
- Integrate quantum sensors (NV-centers, atomic gravimeters, quantum NDI) where applicable.
- Emit `test_execution`, `correlation_analysis`, `quantum_measurement` DET with measurement uncertainty and traceability.
- Maintain calibration chain for all classical and quantum sensors.
- Ensure test-to-CAE correlation meets fidelity requirements (>90% for certification evidence).
