# BRK-DS Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the **Base Regulatory Knowledge Data Set (BRK‑DS) Requirements Library** as requested in the problem statement. The library provides structured regulatory requirements that can be "dropped straight into SRS/SDD and compliance matrix" for EASA regulatory compliance.

## Implementation Statistics
- **8 regulatory domains** implemented with requirements.yaml files
- **17 total regulatory requirements** (BRK-GOV-001 through BRK-IS-001)
- **Full YAML validation** passing (yamllint -s)
- **C-AMEDEO framework integration** with DET, TRACES, and CADET patterns
- **Complete documentation** with README, integration guide, and registry

## Implemented Domains

| Domain | Name | Requirements | Status | Key Regulations |

| GOV | Global Governance | 5 | ✅ Complete | EU 2018/1139, Part-IS, EU 376/2014 |
| BASIC | Basic Regulation | 2 | ✅ Complete | Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 |
| IA | Initial Airworthiness | 3 | ✅ Complete | Part 21 Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 |
| CS | Airworthiness Specifications | 1 | ✅ Complete | EASA CS-25, CS-27, CS-29 |
| CAW | Continuing Airworthiness | 2 | ✅ Complete | Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 |
| OPS | Air Operations | 2 | ✅ Complete | Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 |
| UAS | Drones | 1 | ✅ Complete | Regulations 2019/947 & 2019/945 |
| IS | Information Security | 1 | ✅ Complete | Part-IS Regulation (EU) 2023/203 |

## Key Files Created

### Core Library Files
- `BRK-DS/README.md` - Main library documentation
- `BRK-DS/brk-ds-registry.yaml` - Master registry with domain mappings
- `BRK-DS/INTEGRATION.md` - Comprehensive integration guide

### Domain Requirements Files
- `BRK-DS/GOV/requirements.yaml` - Global governance (5 requirements)
- `BRK-DS/BASIC/requirements.yaml` - Basic Regulation (2 requirements)
- `BRK-DS/IA/requirements.yaml` - Initial Airworthiness (3 requirements)
- `BRK-DS/CS/requirements.yaml` - Airworthiness Specifications (1 requirement)
- `BRK-DS/CAW/requirements.yaml` - Continuing Airworthiness (2 requirements)
- `BRK-DS/OPS/requirements.yaml` - Air Operations (2 requirements)
- `BRK-DS/UAS/requirements.yaml` - UAS/Drones (1 requirement)
- `BRK-DS/IS/requirements.yaml` - Information Security (1 requirement)

### Integration Example
Updated existing component at:
`C-AMEDEO-FRAMEWORK/.../CE-CC-CI-CAD-Q100-AAA-ATA-02-10-01-MASS-PROPS-MASTER/requirements/requirements.yaml`

Demonstrates how to integrate BRK-DS requirements into existing components.

## Technical Features

### Repository Compliance
- ✅ Follows existing requirements.yaml format from `.github/instructions/requirements.instructions.md`
- ✅ Uses proper CE/CC/CI link structure
- ✅ Includes required meta fields (owner, reviewer, last_updated, change_ref)
- ✅ Passes yamllint validation
- ✅ Uses English-only documentation

### C-AMEDEO Framework Integration
- ✅ **DET Integration**: Requirements include DET evidence patterns
- ✅ **TRACES Framework**: Bidirectional traceability support
- ✅ **CADET Integration**: Circular assurance metrics compatibility
- ✅ **ATA SNS Compliance**: Follows ATA iSpec 2200 structure

### Regulatory Compliance Features
- ✅ **EASA Source References**: All requirements trace to official EASA sources
- ✅ **Legal Basis Citations**: Specific regulation and part references
- ✅ **Evidence Requirements**: Clear acceptance criteria and verification methods
- ✅ **AltMoC/AMOC Support**: Alternative means of compliance hooks
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete regulatory source anchoring

## Usage Examples

### 1. Copy Requirements to Component
```bash
cp BRK-DS/BASIC/requirements.yaml \
   your-component/requirements/brk-basic.yaml
```

### 2. DET Integration
```json
{
  "det_id": "DET:CAD:AAA:02-10:req_baseline:V1",
  "compliance_evidence": {
    "brk_requirements": ["BRK-IA-001", "BRK-CS-001"],
    "regulatory_source": "EASA Part 21, CS-25"
  }
}
```

### 3. Compliance Matrix
Requirements can be directly imported into compliance matrices with:
- Requirement ID (e.g., BRK-GOV-001)
- Regulation reference (e.g., Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139)
- Means of compliance (Process/Analysis/Test/Inspection)
- Evidence file references
- Status tracking

## Future Expansion
The library is designed for easy expansion:
- 31 additional regulatory domains identified but not yet implemented
- Template structure ready for programme-specific extensions
- Integration patterns established for new domains

## Validation Results
- ✅ All YAML files pass `yamllint -s .` validation
- ✅ Integration example validates successfully
- ✅ No conflicts with existing repository structure
- ✅ Follows all repository coding conventions

## Impact
This implementation provides the C-AMEDEO ecosystem with:
1. **Ready-to-use regulatory requirements library**
2. **Structured compliance approach** for EASA regulations
3. **Evidence-based compliance tracking** via DET patterns
4. **Audit-ready documentation** with regulatory source links
5. **Scalable framework** for programme-specific expansion

The BRK-DS library directly addresses the problem statement's requirement for "domain packs with terse, testable 'shall' requirements and trace hooks to governing EU/EASA sources" that can be "dropped straight into SRS/SDD and compliance matrix."
