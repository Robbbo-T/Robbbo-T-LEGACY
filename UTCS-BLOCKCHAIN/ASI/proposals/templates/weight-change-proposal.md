# TekDAO Weight Change Proposal

**Proposal ID**: ASI-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{sequence}  
**Type**: Metric Weight Adjustment  
**Submitted**: {timestamp}  
**Proposer**: ASI Oracle  

## Summary
This proposal recommends adjusting ASI metric weights based on observed performance patterns and sustainability outcomes.

## Proposed Changes

### Current Weights
```yaml
metrics:
  cav_reuse_multiplier: {current_weight}
  cav_energy_efficiency: {current_weight}  
  cav_spillover_effect: {current_weight}
  cli_novelty_score: {current_weight}
  cli_coherence: {current_weight}
  cli_emergence_rate: {current_weight}
  baf_roi_projection: {current_weight}
  baf_sustainability_alignment: {current_weight}
  baf_risk_mitigation: {current_weight}
```

### Proposed Weights
```yaml
metrics:
  cav_reuse_multiplier: {proposed_weight}
  cav_energy_efficiency: {proposed_weight}
  cav_spillover_effect: {proposed_weight}
  cli_novelty_score: {proposed_weight}
  cli_coherence: {proposed_weight}
  cli_emergence_rate: {proposed_weight}
  baf_roi_projection: {proposed_weight}
  baf_sustainability_alignment: {proposed_weight}
  baf_risk_mitigation: {proposed_weight}
```

## Justification

### Performance Analysis
- **Metric effectiveness**: {analysis of which metrics best predict value}
- **Correlation study**: {cross-metric correlation findings}
- **Outcome validation**: {comparison with actual sustainability results}

### Observed Patterns
- **High performers**: {artifacts that consistently score well}
- **Undervalued innovations**: {artifacts that deliver value but score low}
- **Gaming resistance**: {evidence that weights resist manipulation}

### Sustainability Alignment
- **Carbon reduction**: {correlation between scores and COâ‚‚ savings}
- **Energy efficiency**: {correlation between scores and energy savings}
- **Circular economy**: {correlation between scores and reuse metrics}

## Impact Assessment

### Leaderboard Changes
- **Top 10 changes**: {expected changes in top rankings}
- **Domain balance**: {impact on domain representation}
- **Innovation diversity**: {effect on innovation cluster diversity}

### Incentive Alignment
- **Behavior prediction**: {how changes will affect artifact development}
- **Sustainability focus**: {whether changes improve sustainability alignment}
- **Innovation encouragement**: {impact on breakthrough innovation incentives}

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Testing (2 weeks)
- Run shadow scoring with proposed weights
- Compare results with current scoring
- Validate against historical performance

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (4 weeks)
- Implement 50% of weight changes
- Monitor for unintended consequences
- Collect stakeholder feedback

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (2 weeks)
- Apply complete weight changes
- Update documentation and training
- Establish new baseline metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Gaming attempts**: Artifacts optimized for new weights
2. **Innovation reduction**: Decreased diversity in innovation approaches
3. **Domain bias**: Unintended advantage to specific domains

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Multi-metric validation**: No single metric dominates scoring
2. **Regular review cycles**: Quarterly weight assessments
3. **Stakeholder monitoring**: Community feedback integration

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- Improved correlation between ASI scores and sustainability outcomes
- Increased innovation diversity across domains
- Enhanced predictive accuracy for valuable artifacts

### Qualitative Measures
- Stakeholder satisfaction with ranking fairness
- Community confidence in ASI scoring
- Alignment with organizational sustainability goals

## Review and Approval

**Required Approvals**: 
- [ ] Technical Review Committee
- [ ] Sustainability Committee  
- [ ] TekDAO Vote (>50% approval required)

**Review Period**: 7 days  
**Implementation Date**: {implementation_date}  
**Next Review**: {next_review_date}
