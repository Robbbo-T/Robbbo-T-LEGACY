      - "All CE/CC/CI elements (per repo anchors)"
```

## Usage Instructions

1) Copy this file into docs/requirements/system/ and baseline via PR.
2) Validate:
- yamllint -s .
- python UTCS-BLOCKCHAIN/validate_utcs_mi.py "$(git ls-files '*.md' '*.yaml' '*.yml')"
- python scripts/brex_lite_validate_requirements.py docs/requirements/system/AMPEL360-H2-BWB-Q_Requirements_Baseline_v1.1.md
- npm run validate:events

3) Ensure CE/CC/CI links resolve to real anchors in your repo.

## Required Reviews

- [ ] Technical accuracy review by domain expert
- [ ] Traceability review to standards and regulations
- [ ] Links validation to CE/CC/CI elements
- [ ] Criticality assessment (DAL level assignment)
- [ ] Verification method feasibility review
- [ ] Final approval by requirements owner

## Notes

- Hydrogen requirements explicitly reference LH₂ (cryogenic), not CH₂ (compressed).
- ARINC 653 + CAST‑32A called out for IMA on multicore.
- Quantum determinism: simulator bit‑for‑bit; hardware statistical repeatability with classical fallback.
