# CADET - Circularity Assurance by Digital Evolutive Twin

**Circularity Assurance by Digital Evolutive Twin**  
*© Amedeo Pelliccia 2025*

## Overview

CADET is a transversal governance layer that ensures the principles of the C-AMEDEO framework are met with verifiable evidence. While the DET (Digital Evidence Twin) provides the immutable *record* of every action, CADET provides the *assurance* that these actions comply with the circular lifecycle objectives.

## Purpose

To act as the guarantor of circularity by leveraging the **Digital Evidence Twin (DET)**. CADET bridges the gap between circular economy principles and measurable, auditable outcomes.

## Core Functions

### [Traceability Verification](./TRACEABILITY_VERIFICATION/)
Continuously audits the DET to confirm that assets from the `CA-DEOPTIMISE` flow are correctly identified, recovered, and reinserted into the `CA-OPTIMISED` flow.

### [Circularity KPI Measurement](./CIRCULARITY_KPI_MEASUREMENT/)
Calculates and reports key metrics such as:
- Percentage of reused components
- Reduction in waste generation
- Lifecycle extension achieved
- Material recovery rates
- Energy efficiency improvements

### [Sustainability Compliance](./SUSTAINABILITY_COMPLIANCE/)
Generates automated reports for sustainability standards:
- **ISO 14001:** Environmental management systems
- **CSRD:** Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
- **GRI:** Global Reporting Initiative standards
- **TCFD:** Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

### [Lifecycle Closure Audits](./LIFECYCLE_CLOSURE_AUDITS/)
Formalizes the successful completion of a full `DEOPTIMISE` → `OPTIMISED` cycle, proving that the perpetual lifecycle is not just a philosophy but a measured and auditable reality.

## Key Features

### Digital Evidence Integration
- **Immutable Logging:** All circularity actions are recorded in the DET
- **Blockchain Verification:** Cryptographic proof of circular transactions
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of circular performance
- **Audit Trail:** Complete traceability from design to end-of-life

### Automated Reporting
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Real-time circularity metrics
- **Compliance Reports:** Automated regulatory reporting
- **Performance Tracking:** KPI monitoring and trending
- **Alert Systems:** Early warning for compliance deviations

### Verification Mechanisms
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated compliance verification
- **AI-powered Analysis:** Pattern recognition for circular flows
- **Cross-reference Validation:** Multi-source data verification
- **Third-party Auditing:** External validation capabilities

## Circularity Metrics

### Primary KPIs
1. **Material Circularity Rate:** % of materials kept in circular use
2. **Component Reuse Rate:** % of components successfully transitioned
3. **Waste Elimination Rate:** % reduction in waste generation
4. **Energy Recovery Efficiency:** % of energy recovered and reused
5. **Lifecycle Extension Factor:** Multiplier of original design life

### Secondary KPIs
- Carbon footprint reduction
- Resource efficiency improvements
- Economic value retention
- Knowledge transfer effectiveness
- Innovation catalyst rate
