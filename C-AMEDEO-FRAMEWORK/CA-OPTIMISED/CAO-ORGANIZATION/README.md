## 1. Purpose and Mission (Optimization Context)

The **CAO (Computer-Aided Organization)** pillar in the **CA-OPTIMISED** flow serves as the **adaptive strategic engine** for organizational evolution. Its mission is to continuously optimize organizational structure, governance, resources, and compliance framework based on operational feedback and lessons learned. CAO in this context focuses on restoration, evolution, and adaptive optimization of organizational capabilities.
