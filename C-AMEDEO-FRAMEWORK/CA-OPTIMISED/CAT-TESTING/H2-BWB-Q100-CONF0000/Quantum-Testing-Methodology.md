# Quantum-Enhanced Testing Methodology
## BWB-Q100 Test Campaign

### Overview

This document establishes the methodology for integrating quantum sensors and quantum computing optimization into the BWB-Q100 physical test campaign, achieving unprecedented measurement precision and test efficiency.

## Quantum Test Optimization (QAOA)

### Problem Formulation
The test selection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem:

```
Objective: Maximize Information_Gain(X) subject to:
- Budget constraint: Cost(X) ≤ €45M
- Schedule constraint: Time(X) ≤ 18 months  
- Resource constraint: Personnel(X) ≤ 45 engineers
```

Where X is a binary vector indicating test selection.
