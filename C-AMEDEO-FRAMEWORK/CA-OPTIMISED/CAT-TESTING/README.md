# CAT — Computer-Aided Testing
## Pruebas Asistidas por Computador

**UTCS-MI v5.0:** `UniversalStandard:Component-DefinitionOfPillar-QAL-CAT-ComputerAidedTesting-v1.1`

---

## 1. Purpose and Mission

The **CAT (Computer-Aided Testing)** pillar is the **physical validation engine and reality anchor** of the QAL ecosystem. Its mission is to plan, execute, and analyze a rigorous physical testing program to validate [CAE](../CAE-ENGINEERING/) predictions, correlate digital models, and generate empirical evidence for certification. CAT is the bridge where "bits meet atoms," ensuring that the digital twin is not only internally consistent but is a faithful reflection of the physical reality of the product.

## 3. Integration in QAL Lifecycle

CAT is the final validator of the design and analysis chain, providing "field truth."

### Main Inputs:
- Validation requirements and predictions from [CAE](../CAE-ENGINEERING/) Evidence Packs
- [CAD](../CAD-DESIGN/) models from DMM for fixture design and instrumentation planning
- Certification Plan (from [CAV](../CAV-VERIFICATION/)) to define which tests require authority witness

### Main Outputs (Physical Evidence Artifacts):
- **Correlated Test Reports:** Formal documents comparing physical results with digital predictions and quantifying error
- **Correlated Models:** Updated versions of [CAE](../CAE-ENGINEERING/) models that have been "tuned" with real-world data
- **Test Evidence for Certification:** DET Evidence Packs containing all data and metadata from a physical test, digitally signed, for use in [CAV](../CAV-VERIFICATION/) certification dossier

### Success Metrics (KPIs):
- **Model Fidelity:** Percentage error between [CAE](../CAE-ENGINEERING/) and CAT post-correlation
- **Test Efficiency:** Information obtained per cost/time ratio
- **First-Time-Right Rate:** % of tests validating CAE predictions without redesign
- **Validation Coverage:** % of key requirements validated with physical evidence

## 4. Quantum Enhancements for CAT

CAT leverages quantum computing to optimize test planning and achieve measurement precision levels impossible with classical sensors.

### Test Plan Optimization (QAOA/QUBO):
The complete test program (thousands of potential test points) is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. **QAOA** is used to select the minimum subset of test points that maximizes requirement coverage and model uncertainty reduction, subject to budget and time constraints. This ensures maximum test program efficiency.

### Quantum Sensors (Quantum Sensing):
For ultra-precise measurements, quantum sensors are integrated into test benches:
- **NV-Center Magnetometers:** For unprecedented precision mapping of magnetic fields around 540 VDC high-power systems, validating electromagnetic interference (EMI) models
- **Atomic Gyroscopes:** For calibrating Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) with stability and precision orders of magnitude superior to classical systems
- **Quantum Imaging:** Using entangled light for non-destructive inspection (NDI) of composite materials, detecting microcracks much smaller than those detectable with conventional ultrasound or X-rays

### Calibration with Entangled Sensors:
Entangled sensor pairs are used to eliminate common noise in complex measurement system calibration, such as wind tunnels, achieving uncertainty reduction in aerodynamic measurements.

  namespace: "DET:CAT:{DOMAIN}:{SNS}:{activity}:V{rev}"
  evidence_types:
    - test_data: "Raw sensor measurements"
    - correlation: "CAE vs test comparison"
    - calibration: "Sensor calibration certificates"
    - environment: "Test conditions and setup"
  quantum_data:
    - sensor_precision: "Quantum sensor measurements"
    - optimization: "QAOA test selection results"
  signatures:
    - cryptographic: "Ed25519 digital signature"
    - quantum: "Post-quantum cryptography ready"
```

## 7. Test Campaign Timeline

## 8. Integration with Other Pillars

### Input Dependencies:
- **[CAD](../CAD-DESIGN/):** Geometric models for fixture design
- **[CAE](../CAE-ENGINEERING/):** Analysis predictions for validation
- **[CAM](../CAM-MANUFACTURING/):** Manufacturing process constraints

### Output Dependencies:

**Final Note:** The CAT pillar is much more than a simple "testing department." It is an integral component of the digital thread that closes the loop between the virtual and physical worlds. By optimizing planning and employing next-generation sensors, CAT not only validates design but continuously enriches and improves the digital twin, increasing confidence in simulations and accelerating certification.
