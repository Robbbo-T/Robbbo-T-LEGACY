# CAB-BRAINSTORMING — Computer-Aided Brainstorming Pillar

## Overview

The **CAB (Computer-Aided Brainstorming)** pillar is the **exploration and conceptual genesis phase** of the QAL ecosystem. Its mission is to translate market needs and strategic objectives defined in CAO into a diverse and evaluated set of solution concepts for the BWB-Q100 hydrogen-powered aircraft.

## Quantum-Enhanced Innovation Engine

CAB acts as an innovation funnel, utilizing computational tools to explore vast design spaces, generate novel ideas, and select the most promising candidates for development in CAD.
