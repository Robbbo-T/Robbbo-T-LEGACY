## Overview

The OEGI certification process transforms Genesis Artifacts from initial concepts into certified intellectual property with clear provenance, licensing, and remunerative rights. The process balances thorough validation with operational efficiency.

## Process Flow (End-to-End)

### Phase 1: Pre-Registration (Day 0)
**Duration**: Immediate (< 1 hour)
**DET Event**: `DET:OEGI:PRE_REGISTER:V<rev>`

1. **Artifact Submission**
   - Upload Genesis Artifact metadata and hash
   - Declare license intent (GL-EU-BY/BY-RC/BY-RF)
   - Pay pre-registration fee (€50)

2. **Timestamp Generation**
   - Immutable timestamp issued via QAUDIT
   - Provisional OEGI-AG-YYYY-NNNNNN identifier assigned
   - Pre-registration certificate issued

3. **Initial Validation**
   - Hash verification and integrity check
   - Basic format compliance (UTCS-MI headers)
   - Minimum documentation completeness

**Output**: Pre-registration certificate with timestamp and provisional ID

### Phase 2: Eligibility Examination (Days 1-10)
**Duration**: 10 business days
**DET Event**: `DET:OEGI:ELIGIBILITY:V<rev>`

1. **Automated Screening** (Days 1-3)
   - GI² score computation (minimum 0.6 threshold)
   - Formal structure verification
   - Provenance graph analysis
   - Prior art detection via quantum-enhanced search

2. **Human Expert Review** (Days 4-8)
   - Originality assessment (test 1/5)
   - Applicability verification (test 2/5)  
   - Verifiability validation (test 3/5)
   - Legal traceability check (test 4/5)
   - Directionality analysis (test 5/5)

3. **Eligibility Decision** (Days 9-10)
   - **Pass**: Requires 3/5 criteria met + GI² ≥ 0.6
   - **Conditional Pass**: Additional evidence required
   - **Reject**: Clear reasoning provided, appeal possible

**Output**: Eligibility determination with detailed scoring

### Phase 3: Public Opposition (Days 11-40)
**Duration**: 30 calendar days
**DET Event**: `DET:OEGI:OPPOSITION:V<rev>` (if filed)

1. **Publication** (Day 11)
   - Public registry listing with metadata
   - Searchable via OEGI Genesis Registry
   - Notification to relevant standards bodies

2. **Opposition Period** (Days 11-40)
   - Third parties can file oppositions (€200 fee)
   - Valid grounds: prior art, non-eligibility, attribution disputes
   - Evidence submission and review process

3. **Opposition Resolution** (Days 35-40)
   - Mediation attempts for attribution disputes
   - Technical review for prior art claims
   - Decision with reasoning and evidence

**Output**: Opposition resolution (if any) or clear passage

### Phase 4: Certification (Days 41-45)
**Duration**: 5 business days  
**DET Event**: `DET:OEGI:CERTIFY:V<rev>`

1. **Certification Level Assignment**
   - **Core**: Basic verification, suitable for research use
   - **Pro**: Enhanced verification with reproducibility evidence
   - **Standard-linked**: Connected to formal standards bodies

2. **Final Documentation**
   - Complete provenance graph
   - License selection confirmation
   - Attribution requirements specification
   - FRAND tariff applicability (if BY-RF selected)

3. **Certificate Issuance**
   - Signed digital certificate via PQC-Dilithium3
   - Public key infrastructure integration
   - Blockchain anchor for immutability

**Output**: Official OEGI certification with full legal standing

### Phase 5: Publication and Activation (Day 46+)
**Duration**: 1 business day
**DET Event**: `DET:OEGI:ACTIVATE:V<rev>`

1. **Registry Publication**
   - Full public record with searchable metadata
   - License terms and attribution requirements
   - Contact information and dispute mechanisms

2. **Clearing System Integration** (if BY-RF)
   - Tariff schedule integration
   - Collection mechanism activation  
   - Distribution profile setup

3. **Standards Body Notification**
   - Automated notification to CEN/CENELEC/ETSI
   - Integration with procurement databases
   - Patent office cross-referencing

**Output**: Active Genesis Artifact ready for use and licensing
