## AMPEL360 V Transponder — Heuritma Integration (AQUA V OS)

Context

This addition establishes the AMPEL360 V Transponder as a multimodal sensorial synthesizer at the core of AQUA V’s operating system. By uniting 360° vision fusion with Heuritmatic synthesis and execution layers, sensor data is no longer siloed by modality (lidar, radar, optical, structural, cognitive) but optimised into a unified state vector.

What this changes

- Transponders evolve from simple comms relays into cognitive system nodes.
- Sensor fusion is elevated from linear filtering to Heuritmatic processing (Amplify → Modulate → Mix → Ponder).
- Execution is coupled directly to synthesis, enabling real-time autonomous control and AI copilot augmentation.
- Networking gains trust and traceability through GAIA AIR Infranet and QUAChain notarisation.

Why this matters

- Provides full-spectrum situational awareness for AMPEL360 airframes, essential for hydrogen-powered BWB safety envelopes.
- Creates scalable intelligence kernels: every transponder is both a sensor node and a decision node.
- Ensures traceable evidence flows (DET) that close the loop between sensing, synthesis, execution, and evaluation.
- Forms a foundational building block of AQUA V OS, embedding sensorial synthesis directly into aircraft architectures and domain ontologies.
