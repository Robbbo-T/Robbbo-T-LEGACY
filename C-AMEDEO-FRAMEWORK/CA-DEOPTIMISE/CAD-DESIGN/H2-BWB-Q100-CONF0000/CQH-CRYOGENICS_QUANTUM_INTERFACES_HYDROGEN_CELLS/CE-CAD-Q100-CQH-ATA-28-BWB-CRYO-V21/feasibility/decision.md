- **Technical Risk**: Medium
- **Cost**: Moderate
- **Verdict**: **INSUFFICIENT**

### Option 3: Active ZBO System (Selected)
- **Boil-off Rate**: <0.1%/day (target achieved)
- **ZBO Power**: 300W at 20K, 25kW electrical
- **Operational Impact**: Acceptable fuel loss, meets requirements
- **Certification**: Compliant with CS-25 + Special Conditions
- **Cost**: Higher initial, significantly lower operational
- **Verdict**: **SELECTED**

### Option 4: Hybrid Passive/Active System
- **Boil-off Rate**: 0.15%/day
- **Technical Complexity**: High
- **Cost**: Highest
- **Verdict**: **OVER-ENGINEERED**

| **Development Risk** | 5% | 10/10 | 8/10 | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| ****Weighted Score** | | **3.1** | **6.2** | **8.2** | **6.8** |

## Key Decision Factors

### 1. Regulatory Compliance
- CS-25 Special Conditions for hydrogen mandate <0.1%/day boil-off
- Only Option 3 meets this requirement with margin
- Certification path is well-defined for active ZBO systems

### 2. Operational Economics
- **Fuel Cost Impact**: $405.7 net savings per flight vs no ZBO
- **Payback Period**: 4.2 years (18,500 flights)
- **20-Year NPV**: $24.3M positive

### 3. Technical Maturity
- ZBO refrigeration technology at TRL 6
- MLI insulation systems at TRL 9
- System integration risk assessed as MEDIUM
- Clear development pathway identified

### 4. Safety Performance
- Meets all hydrogen safety requirements
- 22.5 ACH ventilation (>20 ACH required)
- H₂ detection at 0.4% vol (10× below LFL)
- IP67 electrical systems in cryogenic environment

## Implementation Decision

### Recommended Configuration
- **ZBO Refrigeration**: 300W at 20K (Claude/Brayton hybrid)
- **Electrical Power**: 25kW design envelope
- **Storage Configuration**: 4×ML-20 + 4×ML-8 dewars
- **Target Boil-off**: <0.1%/day operational

### Development Approach
1. **Phase 1** (18 months): Detailed design and component development
2. **Phase 2** (24 months): Prototype testing and validation
3. **Phase 3** (36 months): Certification and flight testing

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- 30% thermal margin in ZBO system sizing
- N+N redundancy in critical components
- Early subscale testing program
- Phased certification approach with regulators

## Quantum Oasis Integration Decision

### v0 Implementation (Approved)
- **QKD Systems**: Laser terminals, no cryogenics required
- **Quantum Sensors**: NV-center magnetometry, optical gyros
- **Classical HPC**: Onboard optimization and digital twin
- **Power Impact**: 2.5 kW additional
- **Integration Complexity**: LOW

### v1 Assessment (Future Consideration)
- **4K Photonics/Ions**: Feasible but adds complexity
- **Power Impact**: +8 kW
- **Decision**: Defer to post-v2.1 assessment

### v2 Assessment (Not Recommended for Flight)
- **mK QPU Systems**: Not feasible for flight application
- **Power Requirement**: 150 kW (prohibitive)
- **Mass Penalty**: 2,500 kg
- **Recommendation**: Ground-based applications only
