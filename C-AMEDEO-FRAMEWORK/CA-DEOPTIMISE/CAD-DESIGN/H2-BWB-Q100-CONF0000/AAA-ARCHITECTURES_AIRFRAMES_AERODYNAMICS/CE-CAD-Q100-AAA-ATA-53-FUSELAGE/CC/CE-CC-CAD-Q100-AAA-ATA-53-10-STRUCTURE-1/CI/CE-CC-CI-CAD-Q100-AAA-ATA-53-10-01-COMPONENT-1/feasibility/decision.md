### Option 2: Hexagonal 9-Bubble Configuration  
- **Configuration:** 9 bubbles in hexagonal close-packed arrangement
- **Diameter:** 5.2m each
- **Wall Thickness:** 10-15mm variable
- **Benefits:** Simpler manufacturing, proven assembly techniques
- **Risks:** Higher weight, less optimal load paths

### Option 3: Linear 6-Bubble Configuration
- **Configuration:** 6 bubbles in linear array
- **Diameter:** 6.1m each  
- **Wall Thickness:** 12-18mm variable
- **Benefits:** Simplest manufacturing and assembly
- **Risks:** Highest weight, poor load distribution, potential flutter issues

## Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Tetrahedral | Hexagonal | Linear |
|:----------|:-------|:------------|:----------|:-------|
| Structural Performance | 40% | 9.2 | 7.5 | 5.8 |
| Manufacturing Feasibility | 25% | 6.8 | 8.5 | 9.1 |
| Weight Optimization | 20% | 9.5 | 7.2 | 4.9 |
| Integration Complexity | 15% | 7.8 | 8.2 | 8.9 |
| **Weighted Score** | **100%** | **8.25** | **7.75** | **6.85** |

## Quantum Optimization Results

The QAOA topology optimization revealed:
- **Tetrahedral arrangement:** 15% weight reduction through biomimetic trabecular reinforcement patterns
- **Spiral load paths:** Discovered between bubble intersections, not apparent in classical analysis
- **Modal frequency:** 62.3 Hz achieved (target >60 Hz)
- **Confidence level:** 87% based on quantum kernel regression validation

## Decision

**Selected Configuration:** Tetrahedral 12-Bubble Architecture

**Rationale:**
1. **Superior structural performance** with quantum-optimized load paths
2. **Significant weight savings** (15%) critical for BWB-Q100 performance targets
3. **Modal frequency compliance** with safety margins
4. **Manufacturing risks mitigated** through phased implementation approach

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Prototype single bubble with quantum-optimized thickness map
2. **Phase 2:** Validate intersection reinforcement rings  
3. **Phase 3:** Full 12-bubble integration test
4. **Phase 4:** Production tooling development

## Risk Mitigation

- **Manufacturing complexity:** Invest in AFP (Automated Fiber Placement) tooling
- **Quality control:** Implement 100% NDI inspection protocol
- **Assembly tolerance:** Use precision jigs with laser measurement
