# CAE — Computer-Aided Engineering

**UniversalStandard:** Component-PillarDefinition-QAL-CAE-EngineeringAssisted-v1.1-C-AMEDEO-Framework-CAE-Engineering-AmedeoPelliccia-ca-deoptimise-EngineeringDefinition

## 1. Purpose and Mission

The **CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering)** pillar is the **virtual validation and
performance prediction engine** of the QAL ecosystem. Its mission is to take the
Digital Master Model (DMM) from the [CAD] pillar and subject it to a rigorous set
of high-fidelity multiphysics analyses and simulations. CAE verifies that the design
meets all performance, safety, and durability requirements before manufacturing any
physical prototype. It generates digital evidence (`Evidence Packs`) that demonstrates
design compliance and robustness, forming a fundamental part of the certification case.

## 3. QAL Lifecycle Integration

CAE is the bridge between design and certification, providing digital confidence in the product.

### Primary Inputs:
- `Design Baseline` (DMM, ICDs, EBOM) (from [CAD])
- Performance and safety requirements from `Rationale-Graph` (originated in [CAB])
- Materials data and properties (from `MMM` domain)
- Physical test data for correlation (from [CAT])

### Primary Outputs (Virtual Validation Artifacts):
- **Verified Models:** High-fidelity simulation models whose predictive accuracy has been quantified and validated
- **Evidence Packs:** Immutable and traceable datasets that demonstrate design compliance with specific requirements. These form the basis for certification by analysis
- **Engineering Change Requests (ECR):** If analysis reveals non-compliance, CAE generates formal change requests for [CAD] to modify the design

### Success Metrics (KPIs):
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Error between simulation and physical testing (`<5%` target)
- **Verification Coverage:** % of requirements verified by analysis
- **Computational Efficiency:** Solver execution time, HPC resource usage
- **Problem Discovery Rate:** Number of design issues identified virtually before manufacturing

## 4. Quantum Enhancements for CAE

CAE is a field where quantum computing promises to revolutionize fundamental physics and optimization problems.

### Materials and Chemistry Simulation (VQE):
For the BWB-Q100, this is critical. The **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** is used to simulate from first principles the behavior of:
- **Composite Materials at Cryogenic Temperatures:** Accurately predict the emergence of microcracks and CFRP property degradation in the LH₂ tank
- **Fuel Cell Catalysis:** Simulate reactions in the proton exchange membrane (PEM) to design more efficient and durable catalysts

### Quantum Linear System Solvers (HHL and variants):
The core of many FEA and CFD solvers is solving massive linear equation systems. Algorithms like **HHL** offer theoretical exponential acceleration. While still in research, QAL is prepared with an abstraction layer to route stiffness matrices to quantum solvers as they mature, drastically reducing simulation times.

### Surrogate Models with QML:
For very expensive analyses (e.g., full aircraft CFD in thousands of flight conditions), a **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** model is trained. This "surrogate model" learns the system response and can make near-instantaneous predictions, enabling massive design space explorations (e.g., wing shape optimization) that would otherwise be impossible.

## 5. DET Integration Pattern

CAE activities generate evidence through standardized DET patterns:
