# AAP — AIRPORTS_ADAPTATIONS

## Domain Overview
**Code:** AAP  
**UTCS Category (no-acronym label):** AdaptacionesAeropuertos  
**Name:** AIRPORTS_ADAPTATIONS  
**Description:** Conceptual exploration of airport infrastructure and operational adaptations required to support the H2-BWB-Q100 configuration (hydrogen propulsion, cryogenic handling, BWB geometry).

## CAX Pillar Integration
Participates in **CAB — Brainstorming** within the **CA-DEOPTIMISE** forward creation flow. Outputs feed concept cards, configuration options, early constraints, and DET evidence for down-selection.

## CAB-Specific Focus
Domain-specific concept exploration for the hydrogen-powered blended wing body configuration, emphasizing:
- Compatibility with runway/taxiway geometry and pavement strength.
- Safe, efficient liquid hydrogen (LH₂) storage, refueling, and cryogenic services.
- Gate/stand layout, clearances, and turnaround processes for BWB geometry.
- Emergency, safety, and environmental protection adaptations.

---

## Quantum-Enhanced Concept Generation
- **QML latent-space navigation:** Learn a latent manifold of airport adaptations from historical layouts, standards, and simulated designs to propose novel yet feasible layouts.
- **Grover-accelerated retrieval:** Speed up patent/literature search and internal design retrieval for rare, high-value adaptation patterns.
- **Maximum Entropy principle:** Encourage diverse, information-rich concept sets; avoid premature convergence on conventional layouts.

**Candidate activities (non-exhaustive):**
- `Idea`, `Assumption`, `ConstraintMap`, `LayoutStudy`, `FuelingLayout`, `CryoRouting`, `SafetyHAZID`, `OpsSimulation`, `TurnaroundFlow`, `EmergencyPlan`, `EnvironmentalAssessment`.

## Digital Evidence Twin (DET) Registry

All activities generate DET evidence packs using:

```

DET\:CAB\:AAP:<SNS>:<activity>\:V<rev>

````

**Field semantics**
- `SNS` — Scenario/Session identifier (UTCS-traceable slug, e.g., `MAD-T1-2025Q3-01`).
- `activity` — One of the candidate activities above (CamelCase).
- `V<rev>` — Two-digit revision (`V01`, `V02`, …).

## Configuration

* **Aircraft:** H2-BWB-Q100 (Hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body)
* **Configuration:** CONF0000 (Baseline)
* **Lifecycle Flow:** CA-DEOPTIMISE
* **CAX Pillar:** CAB — Brainstorming

## Airport Adaptation Taxonomy (working set)

1. **Runway & Taxiway Geometry**

   * Turning radii, fillet design, BWB span/planform accommodations.
   * Pavement bearing (PCN/ACN equivalence studies), load dispersal with BWB gear layout.
2. **Stands, Gates & Clearances**

   * Stand geometry for BWB planform, jetway reach/angle, service vehicle envelopes.
   * Blast/ingestion zones and exclusion areas (re-mapped for BWB flow fields).
3. **LH₂ Storage & Refueling**

   * Tank farm siting, separation distances, impoundment, vent/flare stacks.
   * Cryogenic lines routing (trench, overhead), quick-connects, boil-off management.
4. **Turnaround & Ground Ops**

   * Sequencing (fueling vs catering vs boarding), cryo PPE and safe states.
   * Cold-soak effects and equipment staging.
5. **Emergency & Safety**

   * HAZID/HAZOP updates; spill, vapor cloud, and ignition risk controls.
   * Egress routes, muster points, firefighting capabilities (foam/cryogenic protocols).
6. **Environmental & Community**

   * Noise contours for BWB; hydrogen ecosystem impacts; air quality during venting.
   * Water/soil protection near cryogenic infrastructure.
7. **Digital & Control**

   * DET integration with airport digital twin; live sensors for cryo lines, vent stacks.
   * Access control, blockchain notarization of critical state transitions (fueling start/stop).

## Key KPIs & Constraints (initial)

* **Safety risk index** (dimensionless): ≤ 0.02 per operation scenario.
* **Turnaround time**: ≤ 60 minutes target (baseline); stretch ≤ 45 minutes.
* **LH₂ fueling rate**: ≥ 70 kg/min under nominal conditions.
* **Taxi clearance**: ≥ 7.0 m at all critical stations for BWB geometry.
* **Vent dispersion compliance**: All probable wind conditions within safe isopleths.

## Assumptions (v1.0)

* BWB-Q100 wingspan and gear footprint per current CONF0000 mass properties.
* LH₂ at standard airport supply quality; boil-off management via recovery system.
* Airport operations aligned to mixed-fleet environment (legacy + BWB-Q100).
* Regulatory envelopes to be specialized later (placeholder until mapped).

**Note:** The UTCS header uses the non-acronym category label `AdaptacionesAeropuertos` to comply with v5.0 rules, while the domain retains `AAP` and `AIRPORTS_ADAPTATIONS` internally for code/name continuity.
