# LIB - LOGISTICS_INTEGRATED_BLOCKCHAIN

## Domain Overview
**Code**: LIB  
**Name**: LOGISTICS_INTEGRATED_BLOCKCHAIN  
**Description**: Conceptual exploration of LOGISTICS_INTEGRATED_BLOCKCHAIN for BWB-Q100 configuration

## CAX Pillar Integration
This domain participates in **CAB BRAINSTORMING** activities within the **CA-DEOPTIMISE** forward creation flow.

## CAB-Specific Focus
Domain-specific concept exploration for the hydrogen-powered blended wing body configuration.

### Quantum-Enhanced Concept Generation
- **QML Latent Space Navigation**: Exploration of novel LOGISTICS_INTEGRATED_BLOCKCHAIN concepts
- **Grover's Algorithm**: Accelerated patent and literature search for domain innovations  
- **Maximum Entropy Principle**: Discovery of radically different approaches

## Digital Evidence Twin (DET) Registry
All activities within this domain generate DET evidence packs with the pattern:
```
DET:CAB:LIB:<SNS>:<activity>:V<rev>
```

## Configuration
- **Aircraft**: H2-BWB-Q100 (Hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body)
- **Configuration**: CONF0000 (Baseline configuration)
- **Lifecycle Flow**: CA-DEOPTIMISE
- **CAX Pillar**: CAB-BRAINSTORMING
