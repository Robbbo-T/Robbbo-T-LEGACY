# CA-DEOPTIMISE - Forward Creation Flow

**Phase 1 of the C-AMEDEO Framework**

## Overview

The CA-DEOPTIMISE flow represents the forward creation process from initial design through service deployment and sustainment. This flow follows the sequence:

```
CAD → CAE → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAM → CAI → CAS → CAEV
```

## Lifecycle Phases

### [CAD-DESIGN](./CAD-DESIGN/) - Design Artifacts
3D Models, Drawings, Specifications

### [CAE-ENGINEERING](./CAE-ENGINEERING/) - Analysis Artifacts  
FEM/CFD Results, Simulations, Validation Reports

### [CAO-ORGANIZATION_RULES](./CAO-ORGANIZATION_RULES/) - Governance Artifacts
Program Plans, Policies, Organizational Structure

### [CAP-PROCESS_SAFETY_VV_AND_COMPLIANCE](./CAP-PROCESS_SAFETY_VV_AND_COMPLIANCE/) - Process Artifacts
Certification/V&V Plans, Procedures

### [CAT-SOURCE_CODE_SYSTEMS](./CAT-SOURCE_CODE_SYSTEMS/) - Live Technology Repository
SW/HW Code, AI Models, Agents

### [CAM-MANUFACTURING](./CAM-MANUFACTURING/) - Production Artifacts
Manufacturing Plans, MBOM, Instructions

### [CAI-INTEGRATIONS](./CAI-INTEGRATIONS/) - Integration Artifacts
ICDs, Installation Records, Test Results

### [CAS-SUSTAINMENT](./CAS-SUSTAINMENT/) - Operation and Support Artifacts
Manuals, MRO Data

### [CAEV-EVOLUTION](./CAEV-EVOLUTION/) - Evolution Artifacts
EoL Evaluation Reports, Directives

## Configuration Focus

All phases are structured around the **H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000** configuration - a hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body aircraft with quantum-ready abstraction.
