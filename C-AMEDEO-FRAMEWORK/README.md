# C-AMEDEO Framework

**C-AMEDEO** - *Circular Assisted Methods for Evolutive Developments and Entangled Operations*  
© Amedeo Pelliccia 2025

## Overview

The C-AMEDEO Framework implements a circular, perpetual lifecycle methodology for the AMPEL360-BWB-Q Program. It governs the complete development and operational lifecycle through two complementary flows:

1. **CA-DEOPTIMISE** — Forward Creation Flow (DI→CE→CA→CI)
2. **CA-OPTIMISED** — Restoration & Evolution Flow (CAS→CAO→CAP→CAT→CAI→CAM→CAE→CAD)

## Configuration: H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000

This framework implementation focuses on the hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft configuration designated as **Q100-CONF0000**.

### 15 Technological Domains

The framework organizes all activities across 15 technological domains:

1. **AAA** - Architectures, Airframes & Aerodynamics
2. **MMM** - Mechanical Material Monitoring
3. **EEE** - Environmental Remediation & Circularity
4. **DDD** - Defence, Cybersecurity & Safety
5. **EER** - Energy & Renewable
6. **OOO** - Operating Systems, Navigation & HPC
7. **PPP** - Propulsion & Fuels
8. **EDI** - Electronics & Digital Instruments
9. **LIB** - Logistics & Integrated Blockchain
10. **LCC** - Links, Communications, Control & IoT
11. **IIF** - Infrastructures & Facilities Value Chains
12. **CCC** - Cockpit, Cabin & Cargo Systems
13. **CQH** - Cryogenics, Quantum Interfaces & Hydrogen Cells
14. **IIS** - Intelligent Systems Onboard AI
15. **AAP** - Airports Adaptations

## Standards Compliance

### ATA iSpec 2200 Integration
All Configuration Envelopes (CE) use the **ATA iSpec 2200 Subject Numbering System (SNS)** following the format:
```
CE-CAD-Q100-{DOMAIN}-ATA-{CC}-{DESCRIPTION}
```

### S1000D Data Module Codes
Every deliverable resolves to an S1000D Data Module Code (DMC):
```
DMC = Q100-{ATA SNS}-{DC}-{IC}-{ICV}-{LC}-{ISSUE}
```

Where:
- **MIC (Model Identification Code):** Q100
- **SNS:** Subject Numbering System per ATA iSpec 2200
- **DC:** Disassembly Code
- **IC/ICV:** Information Code/Variant
- **LC:** Language Code
- **ISSUE:** Issue number per S1000D

## Digital Evidence Twin (DET) Integration

Every action within the C-AMEDEO framework generates immutable evidence through the **Digital Evidence Twin (DET)**:

```json
{
  "det_id": "DET:<CAX>:<topic>:<tag>-V<rev>",
  "ts": "<ISO8601>",
  "inputs": { /* references to CIs, commits, BOM/MBOM */ },
  "processing": { "tool": "<stack@version>", "params": {} },
  "outputs": { /* metrics and artifacts */ },
  "hash": "<sha256/keccak>",
  "sig": { "alg": "Ed25519|Dilithium2", "by": "<actor@domain>" }
}
```

## CADET - Circularity Assurance

**CADET (Circularity Assurance by Digital Evolutive Twin)** continuously audits DET evidence to prove circularity and sustainability:

- Traceability verification across DEOPTIMISE→OPTIMISED flows
- Circularity KPIs (reuse %, waste reduction, life extension)
- Automated sustainability reporting (ISO 14001, CSRD, GRI)
- Lifecycle closure audits with evidence-backed directives

## Integration with Core Systems

- **AMPEL360:** Risk-aware design optimization and configuration selection
- **AQUA-OS BRIDGE:** Deterministic, certifiable digital backbone
- **GAIA AIR RTOS:** Safety-certifiable real-time execution foundation

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the appropriate lifecycle flow (CA-DEOPTIMISE or CA-OPTIMISED)
2. Select the relevant CAX pillar (CAD, CAE, CAO, etc.)
3. Access the H2-BWB-Q100-CONF0000 configuration
4. Work within the appropriate technological domain
5. Follow the CE structure for ATA-aligned deliverables
