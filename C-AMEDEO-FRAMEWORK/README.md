## Overview

The C-AMEDEO Framework is a meta-framework governing the complete aerospace lifecycle, based on **C**ircular **A**ssisted **M**ethods for **E**volutive **D**evelopments and **E**ntangled **O**perations.

## Purpose

To provide structure ensuring perpetual technology lifecycle through two complementary flows:

## Framework Structure

### [CA-DEOPTIMISE](./CA-DEOPTIMISE/) - Forward Creation Flow
```
CAD → CAE → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAM → CAI → CAS → CAEV
```
Initial design through service deployment and sustainment, culminating in the `CAEV` phase for evaluation and activation of the next evolutionary cycle.

### [CA-OPTIMISED](./CA-OPTIMISED/) - Restoration & Evolution Flow
```
CAS → CAO → CAP → CAT → CAI → CAM → CAE → CAD
```
Sustainability-driven restoration and continuous improvement for perpetual value retention.

## Constitutive Pillars

- **CAD:** Computer-Aided Design
- **CAE:** Computer-Aided Engineering
- **CAO:** Computer-Aided Organization and Operations
- **CAP:** Computer-Aided Process/Planning/Protecting
- **CAT:** Computer-Aided Technology (Source & Code Systems: SW, HW, AI, Agents, Instruction Library)
- **CAI:** Computer-Aided Integrations
- **CAM:** Computer-Aided Manufacturing
- **CAS:** Computer-Aided Sustainment
- **CAEV:** Computer-Aided Evolution

## Formal Function

The overarching governance structure ensuring circular lifecycle where no technology dies, only transforms.

## CADET Integration

### [CADET - Circularity Assurance by Digital Evolutive Twin](./CADET/)
The transversal governance layer ensuring verifiable circular lifecycle compliance through the Digital Evidence Twin (DET).
